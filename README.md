Quick experiment with Commander for terminal node apps.

Getting started:
```
npm i
npm run build
```

To run the command with its parameters all at once:
```
node ./lib/index.js testa John Doe
```
Or
```
node ./lib/index.js a John Doe
```

To run the command with a step by step parameter entry:
```
node ./lib/index.js testb
```
Or
```
node ./lib/index.js b
```
